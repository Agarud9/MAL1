# Machine Learning 1 - University Assignments

This repository contains all assignments completed for the Machine Learning 1 course during the semester. Each folder corresponds to a different assignment, including code, data, and any relevant results.

**1. Getting Started: Airbnb Copenhagen**
   
This assignment involves analyzing recent Airbnb listings in Copenhagen. The primary tasks include data exploration and preprocessing, such as handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.

**2. Candidate Test 2022 - Part 1**
   
This analysis focuses on responses from political candidates in Denmark, collected through tests by two television networks. The tasks involve analyzing candidates' responses by party affiliation, identifying patterns in political stance, and applying classification algorithms to predict party affiliation based on candidates' responses.

**3. Preprocessing: Water Treatment Plants**
   
This assignment is centered on data preprocessing for water treatment plant operations in Denmark. The objective is to clean and prepare the dataset for machine learning, addressing issues like missing values, outliers, and categorical data.

**4. Wind Energy Data Analysis**
   
This assignment involves processing and analyzing wind speed and direction data from mast and meso datasets. Key tasks include resampling, adjusting data intervals, handling time zone differences, and preparing the dataset for subsequent analysis or modeling.

**5. Candidate Test 2022 - Part 2**
   
A continuation of the candidate test analysis, this assignment extends the previous work with clustering analysis and additional party-oriented evaluations. It includes exploring clustering techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN) and visualizing the political landscape of elected candidates.

**6. Neural Networks I - Sentiment Analysis**
   
This assignment applies sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie reviews dataset using neural networks. The primary objective is to classify reviews as positive or negative based on the text content, showcasing the application of neural networks for text analysis tasks.
